# SDL Server Documentation
Content for the [SDL Developer Portal](https://smartdevicelink.com/docs/sdl-server/master/).

## How to Use This Guide

This documentation is written in DocDown format. One repo is linked per platform. That means that all SDL Server documentation can be found in this repo.  Each directory gets a link in the left-hand sidebar. Guides do not currently support multiple pages or sub-directories.

Learn how to use DocDown at the [spec page](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_markdown_spec).
