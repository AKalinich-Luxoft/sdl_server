## Policies

Policies are rules enforced by SDL core that configure how the system can and/or will behave. For example, a policy could prohibit the use of an application (e.g. Flappy Bird) in a specific type of vehicle. In general, policies are configured by an OEM (e.g. Ford, GM, Tesla, etc.) using the SDL server's graphical user interface. Once configured, all policies for a specific vehicle can be requested in the form a JSON document called a policy table. Policy tables are downloaded to a vehicle's head unit where it can be enforced by SDL core.
